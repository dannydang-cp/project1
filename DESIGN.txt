Most of the functins were placed in the file that had the same parameter.

Entity items:

createEntity(): functions were chosen to be placed in entity and set as static because there should be only one type 
of those specific entities and it was only fitting to place them in the entity file as it dealt with them.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Point and Viewport Items:

getIntFromRange():
getNumFromRange():
adjacent():
distanceSquared():
equals():
Functions that had to deal with arithmetic and other math functions were chosen to be placed in the Viewport or Point 
depending on what they needed and did.

Function items

parseFiles(): functions were kept in the original function file because their purposes seem to simply just place the
stated object into the location in the game and it could also fit multiple classes so that's is why I chose to keep
it in the original location.

setAlpha(): function did not seem to have a big impact of the game so I decided to keep it in functions because it's
lack of usefulness.

getImages(): function was also left in the orignal functions file because the image store already had a getImageList
function so therefore there was not much need for this function.

processImageLine(): function seems to deal with the creation of the background and viewport so I decided to leave it
in functions as it will be unused after the game starts running.

load(): function was left in functions with similar reasons with the above functions because it was only used in the
beginning when loading up the game.
